# schrodinger_utils

Various integrations to the [Schrodinger](https://www.schrodinger.com/) ecosystem. With major interest on 
analysis tools for Molecular Dynamics simulations run with Desmond.

Please understand that this work is primarily meant to be used by co-workers and students of the LBBC lab @ University of Milan. Majority of the code was written during my PhD and it was not meant to be shared, thus documentation must be improved.

For anyone interested, please contact me at: tommaso.laurenzi@unimi.it or open an issue.

**IMPORTANT**:
- Some plugins/scripts are unfinished.
- Some plugins/scripts were written a long time ago, when I first started programming and I had limited knowledge of the Schrodinger API. Thus *may* contain smelly code.
- Some major tools, like `mi.py` for calculating Generalized correlations matrix, and `flow.py` to track the paths of certain molecules are also actively developed [here](https://github.com/uliano/xlence_scripts) and supporting other formats via MDAnalyis.

## Overview
- Maestro plugins
- Docs
- Shell scripts
- Input templates

### Plugins for Maestro
- **maestro_applycscheme.py**: Map data to atom colors, requires python repl, exports `map2color()` function.
- **maestro_dummy_at_center_of_mass.py**: Add dummy atom at center of mass of current selection as a separate entry.
- **maestro_interacting.py**: Select interacting atoms between two groups or in current selection.
- **maestro_moi.py**: Draw principal moments of inertia of selected atoms.
- **maestro_notes.py**: Add and manage notes. Notes are added to *project table* entries as properties
- **maestro_pbitches.py**: Gain control over periodic box wrapping in the workspace. Make PBCs your ...
- **maestro_renumber.py**: Better residue renumbering GUI.
- **maestro_resdist.py**: Calculate per-residue distances between multiple versions of the same structure. Draws plots and consensus structure.
- **maestro_resdist_v2.py**: WIP, no GUI. As above, but structures need not be the same, read residue mapping from alignment.
- **maestro_select_by_b_factor.py**: Select residues with B factor above threshold within selection.
- **maestro_transform.py**: GUI to Rotate and Translate workspace structures. Transformations are applied relative to selected reference or to absolute coordinates.

### Docs
- **schrodinger_tips.md**: Some general tips and obscure features.

### Scripts
- **XL_dock.py**: Toy tool to perform protein-protein docking of structures based on cross-link data.
- **\_schrun**: WIP zsh completion function. Could be automated.
- **enhsamp_patched.py**: Patched version of enhsamp.py that returns a string compatible with msj/cfg files.
- **mi.py**: Compute Mutal Information matrix of selected atoms within Desmond trajectory.
- **schrun**: wrapper shell script to allow completions.
- **trj_act.py**: Align, Center and Translate stuff in Desmond trajectories.
- **trj_boxinfo.py**: Report MD box info.
- **trj_conv.py**: Export Desmond trajectory and cms topology to pdb+xtc format.
- **trj_ene.py**: Report energies of and between selected atom groups as calculated by Desmond vrun.
- **trj_fcluster.py**: RMSD based clustering of Desmond trajectory.
- **trj_flow.py**: Track trajectories of solvent molecules within MD.
- **trj_gcluster.py**: Implementation of gromos clustering method.
- **trj_helix_axis.py**: Report principal axis of Î±-helices.
- **trj_interactions.py**: Calculate interactions between selections in MD.
- **trj_log.py**: State and ETA of a running MD job.
- **trj_measure.py**: WIP. Various geometry analyses.
- **trj_periodic_shortest_distance.py**: Measure distances between selections across PBCs.
- **trj_query.py**: Convert times and frame numbers.
- **trj_rmsd.py**: Calculate RMSD and RMSF of selections.
- **trj_sasa.py**: Calculate SASA.
- **trj_ssp.py**: Calculate Secondary Structure information.
